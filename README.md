Coursera currently doesn't offer a single link for all certificates, limiting developers from showcasing their continuous learning achievements from one of the most reputable online education platforms.

My tool addresses this by allowing users to input their certification IDs, after which the backend generates a consolidated SVG of all certifications earned. This means you can easily share your achievements anywhere‚Äîembed them in a GitHub README or any website using just one link.

üì£ This is the beta version. There are many more features to come, which will be rolled out gradually. If you'd like to contribute or have specific feature requests, please contact me via LinkedIn or email. You can find my contact information on my github homepage. Thank you!

‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è This tool is inspired by the [github-profile-trophy](https://github.com/ryo-ma/github-profile-troph), which dynamically generates and displays GitHub Stats Trophies on your README.
